This is a Streamlit web application built for the ORI Case Study (Option 1). This dashboard analyzes logistics data from 7 CSV files to train a machine learning model, predict delivery delays in real-time, and suggest corrective actions.

Problem Solved
This project addresses Option 1: Predictive Delivery Optimizer. The goal is to build an intelligent tool that predicts potential delivery delays before they happen. By analyzing historical data on traffic, weather, order priority, and distance, the app provides a "delay risk score" to help operators make smarter, proactive decisions.
